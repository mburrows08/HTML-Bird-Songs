            Learn about the Rooster!
        </h1>
        <p>An adult male chicken is called a “rooster” and an adult female is called a “hen.” Roosters are larger, usually more brightly colored, and have larger combs on top of their heads compared to hens.  
        <br></br>
        Chickens can fly but because they are heavy, they can only go about 60 meters (200 ft). They have bad senses of smell and taste, but good hearing. They scratch and claw at the ground, looking for food. Baby chicks can eat and walk without help soon after hatching but they still need help keeping warm. Hens lay up to 240 eggs in a year.
        <br></br>
        Roosters have been on farms, crowing loudly, for about 5000 years!
